What my project is:
It is a website fully for entertainment purposes where you can fill out different and fun quizzes.

Why I made it:
It is always fun to learn more about ourselves and so I thought it would be fun to make quizzes where you can connect our personalities to fun things!

How I made it:
I used HTMl and CSS for the design, following an orange-ish color theme. JavaScript was used for the quizzes and counting when the inputs were right or wrong.

What I struggled with:
It was a bit hard initially to learn how JavaScript should pick up your answers, specifically for the personality quiz, and combine the inputs into one output.
